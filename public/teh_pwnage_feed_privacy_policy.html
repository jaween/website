    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 4, 2025</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Teh Pwnage Feed</strong> is a simple Atom feed viewer designed to
      display content from a single, specific feed. We take your privacy
      seriously and are committed to keeping things as private and minimal as
      possible.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The app does not
      track your activity or usage patterns. There are no analytics or
      background data collection mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h2>Feed Content</h2>
    <p>
      The app only fetches content from a publicly available Atom feed and
      displays it within the app interface. All content comes from that external
      source and is shown as-is.
    </p>

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>
      When you click on a link within the feed, it will open in your device’s
      default browser or external application. Teh Pwnage Feed does not
      intercept, modify, or monitor these links.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      No data is stored on your device beyond what is needed to display the feed
      content temporarily while the app is running. Once the app is closed, this
      data is discarded.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      This app does not use any third-party services, SDKs, or advertising
      networks.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If this policy ever changes, the updated version will be made available
      here with a revised effective date.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free
      to reach out to the app developer.
